Open-set Recognition with Adversarial Autoencoders

A deep learning approach to solving the problem of open-set recognition, by
leveraging an encoder-decoder network architecture in conjunction with a
multi-class classifier. The network enables learning a novelty detector that
computes the probability of a sample to belong to one of the known classes
versus being unknown. If known, the multi-class classifiers assigns the class
label to the sample.
